I did this week's assignments on my own
## Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests

| **Statistical Analyses**	|  **IV(s)**  |  **IV type(s)** |  **DV(s)**  |  **DV type(s)**  |  **Control Var** | **Control Var type**  | **Question to be answered** | **_H0_** | **alpha** | **link to paper**| 
|:----------:|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
MANOVA	| 1, isolation | categorical | 2, percentage of avoidance and percentage of physical contact| continuous | 0| continuous (could also be categorical) | 	how do percentage of avoidance and the number of physical contacts change over time | avoidance rise and physical contacts decrease | 0.05 | I Know My Neighbour: Individual Recognition in Octopus vulgaris(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018710) |
  |||||||||
correlation	| 1, paleoecological conditions | continuous | 1, dental microwear signatures| continuous | 0| continuous (could also be categorical) | 	within the Neandertal lineage, the relationship between dental microwear signatures and paleoecological conditions | within the Neandertal lineage, dental microwear signatures are significantly associated with paleoecological conditions | 0.05 | Neandertal versus Modern Human Dietary Responses to Climatic Fluctuations(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153277) |
  |||||||||
logistic regression	| 1, group sizes | continuous | 1, probabilities of experiencing a critical level of scalar stress| continuous | 0| continuous (could also be categorical) | how do probabilities of experiencing a critical level of scalar stress change with different group sizes| lower probabilities of experiencing a critical level of scalar stress are associated with smaller group sizes and higher probabilities with larger group sizes | 0.05 | Modeling Group Size and Scalar Stress by Logistic Regression from an Archaeological Perspective(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091510) |
