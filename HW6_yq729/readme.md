## Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests

Work with one, or maximum two people. 

Choose three tests from the table in the slides 

![stats test](statsTable.png)

one in the top potrion of the chart (chi-sq, t-test, and the ANOVA family of tests) where you are looking for differences between groups, and one in the bottom portion where you are looking for relationships bewteen the dependent and independent variables (correlation, regression, path analysis), and a logistic regression.

MANOVA	| 1, isolation | categorical | 2, percentage of avoidance and percentage of physical contact| continuous | 0| continuous (could also be categorical) | 	how do percentage of avoidance and the number of physical contacts change over time | avoidance rise and physical contacts decrease | 0.05 | I Know My Neighbour: Individual Recognition in Octopus vulgaris(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018710) |

correlation	| 1, paleoecological conditions | continuous | 1, dental microwear signatures| continuous | 0| continuous (could also be categorical) | 	within the Neandertal lineage, the relationship between dental microwear signatures and paleoecological conditions | within the Neandertal lineage, dental microwear signatures are significantly associated with paleoecological conditions | 0.05 | Neandertal versus Modern Human Dietary Responses to Climatic Fluctuations(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153277) |

logistic regression	| 1, group sizes | continuous | 1, probabilities of experiencing a critical level of scalar stress| continuous | 0| continuous (could also be categorical) | how do probabilities of experiencing a critical level of scalar stress change with different group sizes| lower probabilities of experiencing a critical level of scalar stress are associated with smaller group sizes and higher probabilities with larger group sizes | 0.05 | Modeling Group Size and Scalar Stress by Logistic Regression from an Archaeological Perspective(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091510) |
